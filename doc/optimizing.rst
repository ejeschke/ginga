Optimizing Performance
++++++++++++++++++++++

There are several ways to optimize the performance of certain aspects of
Ginga's operation.

OpenCv Acceleration
-------------------
Ginga includes support for OpenCv accelerated operations (e.g. rotation
and rescaling).  *This support is used by default if the package is installed*.

To enable OpenCv support, install the python `opencv` module (you can
find it `here <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/opencv-python>`_).
