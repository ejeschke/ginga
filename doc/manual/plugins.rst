Ginga is written so that most of the functionality of the program is
achieved through the use of plugins.  This modular approach allows a
large degree of flexibility and customization, as well as making overall
design and maintenance of the program simpler.

Plugins are divided into two types: *global* and *local*.
A global plugin has a single instance shared by all channels, while a
local plugin creates a unique instance for each channel.  If you switch
channels, a global plugin will respond to the change by updating itself,
while a local plugin will remain unchanged if the channel is switched,
because its operation is specific to a given channel.  (Ginga's concept
of channels is discussed in :ref:`concepts-channels`.)

This chapter describes the set of plugins that come with Ginga.  Those
interested in writing their own custom plugins should refer to
:ref:`sec-writing-global-plugins` or :ref:`sec-writing-local-plugins`.

An *operation* is the activation of a local plugin to perform some
function.  The plugin manager toolbar at the bottom of the center pane
is the graphical way to start an operation.
