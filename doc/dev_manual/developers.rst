Developing with Ginga
+++++++++++++++++++++

* :ref:`modindex`

Developers interested in using Ginga in their project will probably
follow one of two logical development paths:

- using Ginga toolkit classes in a program of their own design, or
- starting with the full-featured reference viewer that comes with Ginga
  and customizing it for some special purpose, typically by modifying
  one of the plugins or writing a new plugin.

The first approach is probably best for when the developer has a custom
application in mind, needs a minimal but powerful viewer or wants to
develop an entirely new full-featured viewer.  Developers interested in
this direction should head over to the chapter on the viewer object
(see :ref:`ch-developing_with_the_ginga_view_class`).

The second approach is probably best for end users or developers that
are mostly satisfied with the reference viewer as a general purpose tool
and want to add some specific enhancements or functionality.  Because
the reference viewer is based on a flexible plugin architecture this is
fairly straightforward to do.

.. _sec-writing-plugins:

========================================
Writing plugins for the reference viewer
========================================

The philosophy behind the design of the reference viewer distributed
with the Ginga is that it is simply a flexible layout shell for
instantiating instances of the Ginga view widgets described in the earlier
section.  All of the other important pieces of a modern FITS viewer--a
panning widget, information panels, zoom widget, analysis panes--are
implemented as plugins: encapsulated modules that interface with the
viewing shell using a standardized API.  This makes it easy to customize
and to add, change or remove functionality in a very modular, flexible way.

The Ginga viewer divides the application window GUI into containers that
hold either viewing widgets or plugins.  The view widgets are called
"channels" in the viewer nomenclature, and are a means of organizing
images in the viewer, functioning much like "frames" in other viewers.
A channel has a name and maintains its own history of images that have
cycled through it.  The user can create new channels as needed.  For
example, they might use different channels for different kinds of
images: camera vs. spectrograph, or channels organized by CCD, or by
target, or raw data vs. quick look, etc.  In the default layout,
the channel tabs are in the large middle pane, while the
plugins occupy the left and right panes.  Other layouts are possible, by
simply changing a table used in the startup script.

Ginga distinguishes between two types of plugin: *global* and *local*.
Global plugins are used where the functionality is generally enabled
during the entire session with the viewer and where the plugin is active
no matter which channel is currently under interaction with the user.
Examples of global plugins include a panning view (a small, bird's-eye
view of the image that shows a panning rectangle and allows graphical
positioning of the pan region), a zoomed view (that shows an enlarged
cutout of the area currently under the cursor), informational displays
about world coordinates, FITS headers, thumbnails, etc.  Figure
:ref:`fig4` shows an example of two global plugins occupying a notebook tab.

.. _fig4:
.. figure:: figures/global_plugin1.png
   :scale: 100%
   :figclass: h

   Two global plugins: ``Pan`` (top) and ``Info`` (bottom), shown sharing a tab.

Local plugins are used for modal operations with images in specific
channels.  For example, the Pick plugin is used to perform stellar
evaluation of objects, finding the center of the object and giving
informational readings of the exact celestial coordinates, image
quality, etc.  The Pick plugin is only visible while the user has it
open, and does not capture the mouse actions unless the channel it is
operating on is selected.  Thus one can have two different Pick
operations going on concurrently on two different channels, for example,
or a Pick operation in a camera channel, and a Cuts (line cuts)
operation on a spectrograph channel.
Figure :ref:`fig5` shows an example of the Pick local plugin occupying a
notebook tab.

Anatomy of a Local Ginga Plugin
-------------------------------

Let's take a look at a local plugin to understand the API for
interfacing to the Ginga shell.  In Listing 2, we show a stub for a
local plugin.

.. code-block:: python

    from ginga import GingaPlugin

    class MyPlugin(GingaPlugin.LocalPlugin):

	def __init__(self, fv, fitsimage):
	    super(MyPlugin, self).__init__(fv, fitsimage)

	def build_gui(self, container):
	    pass

	def start(self):
	    pass

	def stop(self):
            pass

	def pause(self):
	    pass

	def resume(self):
	    pass

	def redo(self):
	    pass

	def __str__(self):
	    return 'myplugin'


A little more fleshed out example: MyLocalPlugin
------------------------------------------------

This is a skeleton for a local plugin.  It is also good example of
something that actually runs and can be copied as a template for a local
plugin.  This plugin is distributed with the Ginga package and can be
loaded and invoked from a terminal::

    ginga --plugins=MyLocalPlugin --loglevel=20 --log=/tmp/ginga.log

The plugin will be accessible via the "Operation" button in the Plugin
Manager bar.

.. code-block:: python

    from ginga import GingaPlugin
    from ginga.misc import Widgets

    # import any other modules you want here--it's a python world!

    class MyLocalPlugin(GingaPlugin.LocalPlugin):

        def __init__(self, fv, fitsimage):
            """
            This method is called when the plugin is loaded for the  first
            time.  ``fv`` is a reference to the Ginga (reference viewer) shell
            and ``fitsimage`` is a reference to the specific viewer
            object associated with the channel on which the plugin is being
            invoked.
            You need to call the superclass initializer and then do any local
            initialization.

The instance variables "fv" and "fitsimage" will be assigned by the
superclass initializer to self.fv and self.fitsimage--these are the
reference viewer "shell" and the ginga display object respectively.
To interact with the viewer you will be calling methods on one or both
of these objects.

The "fitsimage" object is the ginga image viewer object associated with
the channel.  You can get a good idea of how to programmatically
manipulate this viewer here :ref:`ch-image-viewer-operations`
and by browsing the source of the many plugins distributed with Ginga.
Most of them are not very long or complex.  Also, a plugin can include
any Python packages or modules that it wants and programming one is
essentially similar to writing any other Python program.  We suggest
picking a plugin that looks or does something similar to what you are
interested in, copying it, and modifying it to fit your needs.

Launching and Debugging Your Plugin
-----------------------------------
The easiest way to start out is to create a plugins directory under your
ginga configuration area.  In a terminal::

    mkdir $HOME/.ginga/plugins

Put your plugin in there (a good one to start with is to modify the
MyLocalPlugin example that comes with Ginga)::

    cd .../ginga/examples/reference-viewer
    cp MyLocalPlugin.py $HOME/.ginga/plugins/MyPlugin.py

To load it when the reference viewer starts (and add some logging to stderr
as well as to a file)::

    ginga --plugins=MyPlugin --loglevel=20 --stderr --log=/tmp/ginga.log

To start the plugin from within the reference viewer, use the Plugin
Manager bar just below the color and readout bars.  Use the "Operation"
menu to select your plugin and it should be launched in the right panel.

If you don't see the name of your plugin in the Operation menu, then
there was probably an error trying to load it.  Examine the log and
search for the name of your plugin--you should find some error message
associated with it.

If you select your plugin from the menu, but it doesn't launch a GUI,
there may be a problem or error in the plugin file.  Again, examine the
log and search for the name of your plugin--you should find some error
message associated with it. It may help for you to add some debugging
messages to your plugin (either using self.logger.debug("...") or simple
print statements to stdout) to gauge the progress of building the gui and
plugin starting.

If the plugin launches, but encounters an error building the GUI, it
should show some error messages (and probably a stack trace) in
placeholders in the right panel in the container where it tried to build
the GUI or possibly under the Errors tab.

.. note:: Ginga has a feature for quickly reloading plugins to
          facilitate rapid debugging cycles.  If it is not already
          running, start the "Command Line" plugin
          from the "Plugins->Debug" menu in the menu bar.  If your plugin
          launched (but has some error), make sure you have closed your
          plugin by right clicking (or Control + click on Mac touchpad)
          on the small box representing your plugin in the Plugin
          Manager bar and selecting "Stop".  In the Command Line plugin,
          there is a small box labeled "Type command here:".  Use
          the command "reload_local <plugin_name>"--this will reload the
          python module representing your plugin and you should be able
          to immediately restart it using the Plugin Manager bar as
          described above (if the plugin is of the global plugin
          variety, use the command "reload_global" instead).

          If you have edited third party modules that are included in
          the plugin, this will not be enough to pick up those changes.

A more complex example: The ``Ruler`` Plugin
--------------------------------------------

Finally, in Listing 3 we show a completed plugin for ``Ruler``.  The
purpose of this plugin to draw triangulation (distance measurement)
rulers on the image.  For reference, you may want to refer to the ruler
shown in :ref:`fig6`.

This plugin shows a standard design pattern typical to local plugins.
Often one is wanting to draw or plot something on top of the image
below.  The ``CanvasView`` widget used by Ginga allows this to be
done very cleanly and conveniently by adding a ``DrawingCanvas``
object to the image and drawing on that.  Canvases can be layered on top
of each other in a manner analogous to "layers" in an image editing
program.  Since each local plugin maintains it's own canvas, it is very
easy to encapsulate the logic for drawing on and dealing with the
objects associated with that plugin.  We use this technique in the Ruler
plugin. When the plugin is loaded (refer to ``__init__()`` method), it
creates a canvas, enables drawing on it, sets the draw type and registers a
callback for drawing events.  When ``start()`` is called it adds that canvas
to the widget.  When ``stop()`` is called it removes the canvas from the
widget (but does not destroy the canvas).  ``pause()`` disables user
interaction on the canvas and ``resume()`` reenables that interaction.
``redo()`` simply redraws the ruler with new measurements taken from any new
image that may have been loaded.  In the ``__init__()`` method you will
notice a ``set_surface()`` call that associates this canvas with a
``ImageView``-based widget--this is the key for the canvas to utilize WCS
information for correct plotting.
All the other methods shown are support methods for doing the ruler
drawing operation and interacting with the plugin GUI.

.. _sec-writing-global-plugins:

Writing a Global Plugin
-----------------------
The last example was focused on writing a local plugin.  Global plugins
employ a nearly identical API to that shown in Listing 2, except that
the constructor does not take a ``fitsimage`` parameter.
``pause()`` and ``resume()`` can safely be omitted.  Like local plugins,
``build_gui()`` can be omitted if there is no GUI associated with the plugin.

A template: MyGlobalPlugin
--------------------------

This is a skeleton for a global plugin, and serves as a decent example of
something that can be copied as a template for a global plugin.
This plugin is distributed with the Ginga package and can be loaded and
invoked from a terminal::

    ginga --modules=MyGlobalPlugin --loglevel=20 --log=/tmp/ginga.log

The plugin will be started at program startup and can be seen in the
"MyGlobalPlugin" tab in the right panel.  Watch the status message as
you create new channels, delete channels or load images into channels.

            to build the GUI, but you can also just as easily use explicit

Writing Separately Installable Plugins
--------------------------------------
If you want to distribute your plugin(s) as a separately installable
package and have Ginga discover them when it starts up, you can use the
`Ginga Plugin Template <https://github.com/ejeschke/ginga-plugin-template>`_
to write your own package that installs plugins.

You can include as many plugins in your package as you want.
You write your plugins in exactly the same way as described above, and
they can be either global or local.  For details, clone the repo at the
link above and follow the directions in the README.
