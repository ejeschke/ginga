"""
Skeleton example of a Ginga local plugin called 'MyLocalPlugin'

To enable it, copy it to your $HOME/.ginga/plugins folder (create it first
if it does not already exist), then run ginga with the command:

    $ ginga --plugins=MyLocalPlugin

From the "Operations" menu you should be able to select
Custom->MyLocalPlugin; it should become active under the "Dialogs" tab.
