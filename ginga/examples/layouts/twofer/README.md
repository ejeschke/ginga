### About

This directory defines a set of files that provide a riff on the standard
look and feel of the reference viewer layout called "twofer".  It provides
a second large pane on the bottom to take some of the plugins that would
normally go on the right.

To try it out, specify this directory to the `--basedir` command-line option
when starting the reference viewer.  e.g.
```bash
ginga --basedir=.../twofer
```

See `screenshot.png` for an example of how it looks.
