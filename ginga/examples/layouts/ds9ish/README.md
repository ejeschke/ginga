### About

This directory defines a set of files that provide a "vaguely ds9-ish" look
and feel to the reference viewer layout.  It still uses Ginga concents
throughout however, using channels/workspace instead of frames and using the
plugin architecture.

To try it out, specify this directory to the `--basedir` command-line option
when starting the reference viewer.  e.g.
```bash
ginga --basedir=.../ds9ish
```

See `screenshot.png` for an example of how it looks.
