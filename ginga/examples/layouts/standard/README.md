### About

This directory defines a set of files that provide the "standard" look
and feel to the reference viewer layout.  It is provided here as a starting
point for customization.

To try it out, specify this directory to the `--basedir` command-line option
when starting the reference viewer.  e.g.
```bash
ginga --basedir=.../ds9ish
```

See `screenshot.png` for an example of how it looks.
